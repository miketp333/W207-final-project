    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "PASSNYC is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to broadening educational opportunities for New York City's talented and underserved students. In recent years, the City’s specialized high schools - institutions with historically transformative impact on student outcomes - have seen a shift toward more homogeneous student body demographics.  PASSNYC aims to increase the diversity of students taking the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT). By focusing efforts in underperforming areas that are historically underrepresented in SHSAT registration, we will help pave the path to specialized high schools for a more diverse group of students.\n",
    "\n",
    "PASSNYC and its partners provide outreach services that improve the chances of students taking the SHSAT and receiving placements in these specialized high schools. The current process of identifying schools is effective, but PASSNYC could have an even greater impact with a more informed, granular approach to quantifying the potential for outreach at a given school. Proxies that have been good indicators of these types of schools include data on English Language Learners, Students with Disabilities, Students on Free/Reduced Lunch, and Students with Temporary Housing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of this challenge is to assess the needs of students by using publicly available data to quantify the challenges they face in taking the SHSAT. The best solutions will enable PASSNYC to identify the schools where minority and underserved students stand to gain the most from services like after school programs, test preparation, mentoring, or resources for parents.\n",

    "## Overview of our approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Write this up in prose (copied from the Google Doc):\n",
    "- Treat as a classification problem\n",
    "- Proposed \"success\" class label: # SHSAT registrants normalized by school size\n",
    "- We'll try multiple algorithms (LogisticRegression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, etc…)\n",
    "- We may try PCA for dimensionality reduction, as many features are likely correlated.\n",
    "- Using cross-validation to calculate accuracy (and/or F-score, Precision & Recall, etc…)\n",
    "- Once we have a \"best\" model, use it to predict whether the remaining ~700 schools would be expected to have SHSAT registrations.  We would rank by decreasing level of diversity (and possibly decreasing economic need), which is in alignment with PASSNYC mission.  This represents the end report that PASSNYC is asking for.\n"

    "The original PASSNYC challenge requested a prioritized list of schools that would help meet their objective of increasing the SHSAT registrations by diverse students.  Since the current applicants are predominantly white, we chose to intentionally not train our models on demographic factors such as race in order to avoid reinforcing the current bias (ie. we didn't want a model to suggest that emphasis should be on schools with a high percentage of white students because there's an existing correlation with SHSAT registrations).  Instead, we tried to train a \"race-blind\" classifier.  However, once the full set of NYC schools was run through our model in order to generate predictions, we then ranked the resulting schools by these diversity factors (in descending order).\n",
