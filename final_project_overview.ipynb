    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "PASSNYC is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to broadening educational opportunities for New York City's talented and underserved students. In recent years, the City’s specialized high schools - institutions with historically transformative impact on student outcomes - have seen a shift toward more homogeneous student body demographics.  PASSNYC aims to increase the diversity of students taking the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT). By focusing efforts in underperforming areas that are historically underrepresented in SHSAT registration, we will help pave the path to specialized high schools for a more diverse group of students.\n",
    "\n",
    "PASSNYC and its partners provide outreach services that improve the chances of students taking the SHSAT and receiving placements in these specialized high schools. The current process of identifying schools is effective, but PASSNYC could have an even greater impact with a more informed, granular approach to quantifying the potential for outreach at a given school. Proxies that have been good indicators of these types of schools include data on English Language Learners, Students with Disabilities, Students on Free/Reduced Lunch, and Students with Temporary Housing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of this challenge is to assess the needs of students by using publicly available data to quantify the challenges they face in taking the SHSAT. The best solutions will enable PASSNYC to identify the schools where minority and underserved students stand to gain the most from services like after school programs, test preparation, mentoring, or resources for parents.\n",

    "## Overview of our approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to approach this analysis as a classification problem, by defining a class label related to the proportion of students at a school who register for the SHSAT test (ie. we will define \"high-registration\" schools).  As we will show in our Exploratory Data Analysis, there is a natural break-point around the 75th percentile for registration rate, which is at 38%.  Therefore, schools with a registration rate of 38% or more will be designated as `high_registrations` schools and given a boolean value of '1', while the other ~75% of schools will get a '0'.  We will build models with multiple machine learning algorithms such as LogisticRegression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, and Neural Networks to train and predict on this target variable.  We will explore both feature-rich models, as well as models built after feature selection or a dimensionality reduction technique such as PCA, have been used to reduce the number of features in the model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For assessing quality of our models, we will use an 80/20 train/test split of our dataset.  We will use K-fold cross-validation within the training set for hyperparameter optimization, and will calculate average accuracy and F1 scores (along with 95% confidence intervals) based on the cross-validation results.  Once hyperparameter optimization is complete, we will run the model against our held-out test set and report accuracy and F1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following that, we will prioritize schools for PASSNYC engagement based on a combination of attributes such as performance in the model, registration percentage, class size, proportion of Black and Hispanic students, etc, in alignment with the organization's mission."

    "## Prioritized Engagement Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "Since our dataset contains data for most NYC middle schools already, there is not a large separate, unlabeled dataset that we need to run through our models.  Instead, we will make our recommendations based on an analysis of schools that the models show to have the **highest opportunity to engage with Black and Hispanic students** in order to increase SHSAT registration in this population.  We consider these to be the schools that are most likely to benefit from PASSNYC's intervention and engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to estimate this opportunity, we pursued the following steps:\n",
    "1. Establish a target registration percentage, which is the median percentage of registrations among the \"top\" registering schools (which we define as above 75th percentile, or higher than ~38% registrations).  This is the median of `pct_test_takers`, obtained from the New York Times dataset.\n",
    "2. Multiply this target median by `grade_7_enrollment`, obtained from the DOE, to get a number of students in each school who would need to take the test to be a median high-registrant.\n",
    "3. Subtract `num_shsat_test_takers` (obtained from NY Times) from this number to obtain a delta--the number of students each school is away from its 'target' number (note, for very high performers, this number will be negative).\n",
    "4. Multiply this delta by `percent_black__hispanic`, obtained from the PASSNYC Explorer dataset, to get a relative measure of the size of the opportunity to engage with the minority population at each school.<sup>1</sup>\n",
    "5. Once the various models were tuned to our satisfaction, the entire set of 464 schools underwent a Repeated Stratified K-fold cross-validation.  The schools are divided into five parts, the model is trained on four of those parts and then used to predict the answers for the fifth part.  This is repeated five times so every segment gets predicted, and then the whole list is shuffled and the test repeated a total of 10 times, which means each model is run 50 separate times and each school is predicted 10 times.  This is used to generate a positive measure of confidence for each school - if a model predicts a school is high-registering 10 out of 10 times, it gets a score of 100%.  If it predicts a school to be low-registering 10 times, it gets a score of 0%.  This confidence then multiplied by the school's `minority_delta` to obtain a `score`, which represents the overall measure of minority engagement opportunity for each school.<sup>2</sup>\n",
    "6. The `scores` are then averaged across the four models--K Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Multilayer Perceptron--to obtain the final list below.  The resulting schools are the ones that we recommend PASSNYC engage with for the highest anticipated ROI.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size='1'><p><sup>1</sup>It is important to note that this number, which we call `minority_delta`, is not a measure of the absolute number of minority students who did not take the test, since we do not know the demographic numbers of students who actually took the test--just the demography of the school at large.  The extent to which the test-taking population does not resemble the larger student body will distort this number.  However, it is the best proxy method we could determine to get a sense of the size of the *opportunity* to engage with a black/hispanic population at a school.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><sup>2</sup>Since we are only using this confidence measure on positive predictions, and schools with a high `minority_delta` tend to have low registrations, this mostly results in false positives (ie, schools that the model predicts are high-registering, but aren't).  We do not promote schools that the model is confident are low-registering.  However, a large school with a disproportionately high percentage of black and hispanic students could still be represented, provided their registration numbers were sufficiently below the threshhold.  These schools are marked as `high_registrations` in the final tally.</p></font>"

Schools like IS 230 and JHS 220 John J Pershing, which have unanimous scores, represent equivalent confidence from each model (likely 100%), despite having a relatively smaller number of students to engage.  Other schools, such as IS 145 Joseph Pulitzer, demonstrate considerable volatility among the models, and yet score high due to the size of potential engagement--these might warrant closer examination among the models to see which approach resonates most closely with the philosophy of PASSNYC administrators, and get re-weighted accordingly."
