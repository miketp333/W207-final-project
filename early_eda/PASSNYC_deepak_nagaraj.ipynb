    "The [NYC SHSAT Test Results 2017](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/nyc-shsat-test-results-2017/home) dataset includes...\n",

    "### Aim\n",
    "\n",
    "Improve the chances of students taking the SHSAT and receiving placements in specialized high schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is PASSNYC?\n",
    "\n",
    "PASSNYC is a not-for-profit, volunteer organization dedicated to broadening educational opportunities for New York City's talented underserved students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Promoting Access to Specialized Schools in New York City (\"PASSNYC\") will focus our efforts in underperforming areas that are historically underrepresented in SHSAT registration. In so doing, PASSNYC will help pave the path to specialized high schools for a more diverse group of students.\n",
    "\n",
    "PASSNYC aims to identify talented underserved students within New York Cityâ€™s underperforming school districts in order to increase the diversity of students taking the Specialized High School Admissions Test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what PASSNYC does:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Partner with NYC middle schools and communities in underperforming school districts to increase awareness of SHSAT\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify high-performing students through a combination of interviews, standardized test performance, grades, and educator testimonials.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prepare scholars for SHSAT by connecting with select mentoring and test prep programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is SHSAT?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT) is an examination administered to eighth and ninth grade students residing in New York City and used to determine admission to all but one of the city's nine Specialized High Schools. In 2008, about 29,000 students took the test, and 6,108 students were offered admission to one of the high schools based on the results.[1] On average, 30,000 students take this exam annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Specialized High Schools?\n",
    "\n",
    "The specialized high schools of New York City are nine selective public high schools, established and run by the New York City Department of Education to serve the needs of academically and artistically gifted students. The Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT) examination is required for admission to all the schools except LaGuardia, which requires an audition or portfolio for admission.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to put out a \"potential for outreach\" for each school.\n",
    "\n",
    "Past proxies include data on:\n",
    "* English language learners\n",
    "* Students with disabilities\n",
    "* Students on free/reduced lunch\n",
    "* Students with temporary housing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "The best solutions will enable PASSNYC to identify the schools where minority and underserved students stand to gain the most from services like after-school programs, test preparation, mentoring, or resources for parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Judgement Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "* Performance: Clearly articulate why your solution is effective at tackling the problem.\n",
    "* Influential: Be easy to understand enable PASSNYC to convince stakeholders where services are needed the most.\n",
    "* Shareable: PASSNYC works with over 60 partner organizations to offer services such as test preparation, tutoring, mentoring, extracurricular programs, educational consultants, community and student groups, trade associations, and more. Winning submissions will be able to provide convincing insights to a wide subset of these organizations. "
