PTR must mean pupil-teacher ratio, and appears to have been cleanly joined to all rows, presumably based on DBN.  Based on that description and the above observations re: department/subject columns, I'm going to assume that the \"MS HS Avg\" dataset is represented here are \"MS Core\" and \"HS Core\" grade level.   I'll assume that the individual grade levels [K, 1, ... 8] and \"K-8 SC\" come from the \"K-8 Avg\" dataset.  Spot checking a few middle school DBN's shows that there are records of both types in our dataset, but I'm not able to reconcile the numbers.  \n",
